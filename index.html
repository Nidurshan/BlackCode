        <h2 class="small-title">What is Programming</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
            <p>Programming is the art and science of instructing computers to perform specific tasks or solve problems. It involves writing a set of precise instructions, known as code, using a programming language that a computer can understand. Programmers use their creativity and logical thinking to design algorithms and develop software applications, ranging from simple scripts to complex, sophisticated software systems. Programming empowers individuals and organizations to automate processes, analyze data, create digital experiences, and build technologies that shape our modern world. It's a powerful tool that bridges the gap between human ideas and the digital realm, allowing us to leverage technology to achieve a wide range of goals and innovations.</p>

        <h2 class="small-title">What is Programming Language</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
            <p>A programming language is a formalized set of rules and instructions that allows humans to communicate with and instruct computers effectively. It serves as a bridge between human thought and machine execution. Programming languages provide a structured and understandable way to write code, defining the syntax and semantics that computers can interpret and execute. These languages vary in complexity, purpose, and functionality, with some designed for general-purpose programming, while others cater to specific domains or tasks. Ultimately, programming languages are the essential tools that enable developers and programmers to write software, design algorithms, and create applications that drive technological innovation and power various aspects of our digital world.</p>
